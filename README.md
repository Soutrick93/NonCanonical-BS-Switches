# NonCanonical-BS-Switches
This folder contains the matlab codes to search noncanonical bistable switches and phase diagram calculations using potential energy based bifurcation analysis method.
The matlab codes with names "search_BS_Switch" are for searching parameters for canonical and noncanonical switches.
These codes segregate different bistable switches, store the parameters sperately and count the number of each switches.
The *.dat files contain the values of the threshold parameters generated using half-functional rule. The relevant *.dat files are needed to run the parameter search matlab codes.
The matlab codes with names "phaseDia_BS_Switch" are for phase diagram calculations of bistable switches.
The parscan*.mat are structured data files containing the segregated (sample) parameters for various switches.
